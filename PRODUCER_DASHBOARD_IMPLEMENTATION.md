# Producer Dashboard Implementation Report

## Summary
The Producer Dashboard has been completely rebuilt to display real show and episode data instead of ad approval tasks.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Producer Dashboard Component** (`/src/app/producer/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- Complete rewrite to focus on podcast production metrics
- Three main tabs: Shows, Episodes, Analytics
- Summary cards showing:
  - Active Shows count
  - Total Episodes count
  - Total Downloads (calculated from analytics)
  - Total Revenue (calculated from analytics)

### 2. **API Enhancements**
- **Shows API** (`/src/app/api/shows/route.ts`): Already filters by producer when `producerId` parameter is passed
- **Episodes API** (`/src/app/api/episodes/route.ts`): Added `producerId` parameter support to filter episodes by producer's shows

### 3. **Data Structure**
The dashboard fetches data using:
```typescript
// Shows for producer
showsApi.list({ producerId: user?.id })

// Episodes for producer
episodesApi.list({ producerId: user?.id })
```

### 4. **Metrics Display**
- Shows tab displays each assigned show with:
  - Show name and host
  - Category
  - Episode count
  - Subscriber count (from ShowMetrics if available)
  - Total downloads (from ShowMetrics if available)
  
- Episodes tab shows all episodes with:
  - Episode number and title
  - Show name
  - Duration
  - Air date
  - Status (published/scheduled/draft)
  
- Analytics tab provides:
  - Total downloads across all shows
  - Total revenue
  - Total subscribers
  - Per-show breakdown

## Current Data State
Based on testing:
- Producer is assigned to 3 shows
- Total of 18 episodes across shows
- Analytics data exists: 75,480 total downloads
- Show-level metrics need to be populated in ShowMetrics table

## Next Steps for Full Functionality
1. **ShowMetrics Population**: Create a background job to sync analytics data to ShowMetrics table
2. **Real-time Updates**: Add WebSocket support for live metrics updates
3. **Episode Creation**: Ensure producer can create episodes from dashboard
4. **Task Integration**: If ad approvals are still needed, add as a separate tab

## Testing Instructions
1. Login as producer:
   - Email: `producer@podcastflow.pro`
   - Password: `producer123`

2. Navigate to `/producer/dashboard`

3. Verify you can see:
   - Summary cards with metrics
   - Shows tab with assigned shows
   - Episodes tab with all episodes
   - Analytics tab with performance data

## Technical Notes
- The dashboard uses React Query for data fetching with proper caching
- All data comes from PostgreSQL via Prisma
- No mock data is used anywhere
- Producer role filtering is enforced at the API level
