# Comprehensive Infrastructure Audit Report
Date: 2025-07-25
Auditor: System

## Executive Summary

This audit identified significant unused resources across AWS infrastructure that can be safely removed to reduce costs and complexity. The application has migrated from Lambda/DynamoDB architecture to Next.js/PostgreSQL, leaving many Lambda functions and related resources unused.

## Key Findings

### 1. Lambda Functions (CRITICAL)
- **Total Lambda Functions**: 53
- **Unused (0 invocations in 7 days)**: 47 (89%)
- **Active Functions**: 6 (11%)

#### Unused Lambda Functions to Remove:
```
PodcastFlowPro-APIWebhooks
PodcastFlowPro-Ad-Approvals
PodcastFlowPro-Ad-Copy
PodcastFlowPro-Advertisers
PodcastFlowPro-Agencies
PodcastFlowPro-Availability
PodcastFlowPro-Backup
PodcastFlowPro-Billing
PodcastFlowPro-Contracts
PodcastFlowPro-Episodes
PodcastFlowPro-Financials
PodcastFlowPro-Insertion-Orders
PodcastFlowPro-Reports
PodcastFlowPro-Security
PodcastFlowPro-Shows
PodcastFlowPro-Team
... (and 31 more)
```

#### Active Lambda Functions (Keep):
```
PodcastFlowPro-PodcastFlowPro-clients (1 invocation)
podcastflow-api-analytics (3 invocations)
podcastflow-users (3 invocations)
podcastflow-api-organization (9 invocations)
podcastflow-api-user (9 invocations)
PodcastFlowPro-PodcastFlowPro-users (14 invocations)
```

### 2. API Gateway Endpoints

#### Endpoints Still Connected to Unused Lambdas:
- `/ad-approvals/*` → PodcastFlowPro-Ad-Approvals (UNUSED)
- `/ad-copy/*` → PodcastFlowPro-Ad-Copy (UNUSED)
- `/advertisers/*` → PodcastFlowPro-Advertisers (UNUSED)
- `/agencies/*` → PodcastFlowPro-Agencies (UNUSED)
- `/availability/*` → PodcastFlowPro-Availability (UNUSED)
- `/contracts/*` → PodcastFlowPro-Contracts (UNUSED)
- `/episodes/*` → PodcastFlowPro-Episodes (UNUSED)
- `/financials/*` → PodcastFlowPro-Financials (UNUSED)
- `/insertion-orders/*` → PodcastFlowPro-Insertion-Orders (UNUSED)
- `/reports/*` → PodcastFlowPro-Reports (UNUSED)
- `/shows/*` → PodcastFlowPro-Shows (UNUSED)
- `/backups` → PodcastFlowPro-Backup (UNUSED)
- `/team` → PodcastFlowPro-Team (UNUSED)

**Recommendation**: Remove all these endpoints as the application uses Next.js API routes

### 3. CloudWatch Log Groups

#### Log Groups with No Logs Ever:
- 20+ Lambda log groups with 0 bytes stored
- MarketingAnalytics Lambda log groups (different project?)

**Recommendation**: Delete all empty log groups to reduce clutter

### 4. DynamoDB Tables

#### Tables Found:
- `PodcastFlowPro` - Legacy table (check usage)
- `podcastflow-pro` - Legacy table (check usage)
- `WebSocketConnections` - WebSocket infrastructure
- `WebSocketSubscriptions` - WebSocket infrastructure
- `marketing-integrations-dev` - Different project

**Recommendation**: Verify if WebSocket tables are still needed; remove legacy tables

### 5. S3 Buckets

#### PodcastFlow Related Buckets:
- `podcastflow` - General bucket (verify usage)
- `podcastflow-backups-590183844530` - Backup storage (KEEP)
- `podcastflow-deployments-1751349654` - Old deployments?
- `podcastflow-lambda-deployments` - Lambda deployments (can remove if Lambdas removed)
- `podcastflow-pro-uploads-590183844530` - User uploads (KEEP)

**Recommendation**: Keep backups and uploads buckets; remove deployment buckets after Lambda cleanup

### 6. IAM Roles

#### Lambda Execution Roles:
- `PodcastFlowProLambdaRole` - Used by all PodcastFlow Lambdas
- `podcastflow-api-LambdaExecutionRole-*` - Used by active Lambdas
- `podcastflow-websocket-stack-WebSocketLambdaRole-*` - WebSocket Lambda

**Recommendation**: Keep roles for active Lambdas; remove PodcastFlowProLambdaRole after Lambda cleanup

### 7. Codebase References

#### Found References:
- `https://api.podcastflow.pro` in ApiSettings component (documentation only)
- `/dashboard` routes used throughout but pointing to Next.js routes
- No direct Lambda invocation code found
- No execute-api.amazonaws.com references in active code

**Status**: Codebase is clean - no active references to removed resources

## Cost Impact Analysis

### Estimated Monthly Savings:
- **Lambda Functions**: ~$0 (no invocations, but request charges)
- **CloudWatch Logs**: ~$5-10 (storage for unused logs)
- **API Gateway**: ~$3.50/million requests (preventing accidental calls)
- **DynamoDB**: ~$25-50 (depending on table size)
- **Total Estimated Savings**: $35-65/month

## Recommended Actions (Priority Order)

### Phase 1: Immediate Actions (No Risk)
1. **Delete Empty CloudWatch Log Groups**
   - 20+ log groups with 0 bytes
   - No data loss risk

2. **Remove Unused API Gateway Endpoints**
   - All endpoints pointing to unused Lambdas
   - Application uses Next.js routes

### Phase 2: Lambda Cleanup (Low Risk)
1. **Delete 47 Unused Lambda Functions**
   - 0 invocations in 7 days
   - Not referenced in codebase
   - Backup function code first

2. **Remove Associated IAM Role**
   - PodcastFlowProLambdaRole after Lambda deletion

### Phase 3: Storage Cleanup (Medium Risk)
1. **Review DynamoDB Tables**
   - Check if WebSocket tables are needed
   - Backup and remove legacy tables

2. **Clean S3 Buckets**
   - Remove old deployment buckets
   - Archive old data before deletion

## Verification Checklist

### Before Deletion:
- [ ] Create full backup of all resources
- [ ] Document all resource ARNs
- [ ] Test application functionality
- [ ] Monitor error logs for 24 hours
- [ ] Have rollback plan ready

### After Each Phase:
- [ ] Verify application still works
- [ ] Check CloudWatch for new errors
- [ ] Monitor user reports
- [ ] Document changes made

## Resources Flagged for Human Review

1. **WebSocket Infrastructure**
   - Lambda: `podcastflow-websocket-handler`
   - Tables: `WebSocketConnections`, `WebSocketSubscriptions`
   - **Question**: Is real-time functionality still used?

2. **Active but Low-Use Lambdas**
   - `PodcastFlowPro-PodcastFlowPro-clients` (1 invocation)
   - `podcastflow-api-analytics` (3 invocations)
   - **Question**: Are these being phased out?

3. **Marketing Analytics Resources**
   - Multiple Lambda functions and log groups
   - **Question**: Different project or related?

## Safe Deprecation Steps

### For Each Lambda Function:
1. Download function code: `aws lambda get-function --function-name X`
2. Export function configuration
3. Check CloudWatch Logs last invocation
4. Remove API Gateway integration
5. Delete Lambda function
6. Delete CloudWatch Log Group
7. Monitor for errors

### For API Gateway Endpoints:
1. List all methods for endpoint
2. Remove each method (GET, POST, etc.)
3. Remove the resource
4. Deploy changes to all stages
5. Monitor for 404 errors

### For DynamoDB Tables:
1. Create table backup
2. Export table data to S3
3. Disable table (if supported)
4. Monitor for errors (7 days)
5. Delete table

## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Occur:
1. **Lambda Functions**: Recreate from backup code
2. **API Gateway**: Recreate endpoints and integrations
3. **DynamoDB**: Restore from backup
4. **IAM Roles**: Recreate with same permissions

### Emergency Contacts:
- Keep AWS Support case open during cleanup
- Document all deleted resource ARNs
- Save all configuration exports

## Next Steps

1. **Review this report with team**
2. **Get approval for each phase**
3. **Schedule cleanup during low-traffic period**
4. **Create detailed backup before starting**
5. **Execute Phase 1 (lowest risk) first**
6. **Monitor for 24-48 hours before next phase**
