---

## Quick Start (TL;DR)

```bash
# Navigate to scripts directory
cd /home/ec2-user/podcastflow-pro/infrastructure/audit/scripts

# Execute immediate deletion (5 minutes)
./delete-api-gateway-immediate.sh

## Detailed Execution Steps

### Pre-Execution Verification ✅

All checks already completed - system is ready:
- ✅ Next.js APIs operational
- ✅ Zero API Gateway usage confirmed  
- ✅ Complete migration validated
- ✅ Tenant isolation working
- ✅ Environment properly configured

### Step 1: Execute Deletion (5 minutes)

```bash
cd /home/ec2-user/podcastflow-pro/infrastructure/audit/scripts
./delete-api-gateway-immediate.sh
```

**What this script does:**
- ✅ Verifies Next.js API health
- ✅ Creates emergency backup
- ✅ Confirms zero usage
- ✅ Deletes API Gateway
- ✅ Validates deletion completed
- ✅ Tests Next.js APIs still work

**Expected output:**
```
🚀 Starting immediate API Gateway deletion...
✅ Next.js APIs confirmed healthy
✅ Backup created: /tmp/api-gateway-backup-[timestamp].json
✅ Confirmed zero API Gateway usage
✅ API Gateway deletion command executed
✅ API Gateway successfully deleted
🎉 API Gateway deletion completed successfully!
```

### Step 2: Immediate Validation (2 minutes)

```bash
./validate-apis-immediate.sh
```

**What this script does:**
- ✅ Tests all core business APIs
- ✅ Tests system APIs  
- ✅ Tests master admin APIs
- ✅ Validates database connectivity
- ✅ Confirms tenant isolation
- ✅ Checks response performance

**Expected output:**
```
🔍 Running immediate API validation...
✅ /api/campaigns responding (HTTP 401)
✅ /api/shows responding (HTTP 401)
[... all endpoints tested ...]
✅ Database connection healthy
✅ Tenant isolation schemas present
🎉 All API validations PASSED!
```

### Step 3: Resource Cleanup (Optional - 10 minutes)

```bash
./cleanup-resources-immediate.sh
```

**What this script does:**
- ✅ Deletes CloudFormation stack
- ✅ Removes unused Lambda functions
- ✅ Cleans up CloudWatch log groups
- ✅ Identifies IAM roles for manual review
- ✅ Calculates total cost savings

**Expected output:**
```
🧹 Starting immediate resource cleanup...
✅ CloudFormation stack deletion initiated
✅ Lambda functions deleted
✅ CloudWatch log groups deleted
💰 Total monthly savings: ~$20.50
🎉 Resource cleanup completed!
```

## If Something Goes Wrong (Emergency Rollback)

### Emergency Rollback (15 minutes)

If you encounter any issues:

```bash
./emergency-rollback.sh
```

**What this script does:**
- ✅ Finds latest backup
- ✅ Restores API Gateway from backup
- ✅ Creates prod and production deployments
- ✅ Tests restored API Gateway
- ✅ Provides instructions for switching back

**To switch app back to API Gateway (if needed):**
```bash
# Add to .env.production
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_ENDPOINT=https://[new-api-id].execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod" >> .env.production

# Restart application
npm run build && pm2 restart podcastflow-pro
```

---

## Monitoring & Validation

### Continuous Monitoring (No waiting required)

The scripts provide immediate feedback, but you can also monitor:

```bash
# Check Next.js API health anytime
curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/health | jq '.checks'

# Test specific endpoints
curl -s -I http://localhost:3000/api/campaigns
curl -s -I http://localhost:3000/api/shows
curl -s -I http://localhost:3000/api/dashboard

# Check application logs
pm2 logs podcastflow-pro --lines 20

# Monitor database connections
PGPASSWORD=PodcastFlow2025Prod psql -U podcastflow -h localhost -d podcastflow_production -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;"
```

### Key Metrics to Watch

| Metric | Expected Value | How to Check |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| **API Response** | 200 or 401 | `curl -I http://localhost:3000/api/health` |
| **Database Status** | "pass" | `curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/health \| jq '.checks.database.status'` |
| **Tenant Schemas** | 2+ | `curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/health \| jq '.checks.tenants.details.schemaCount'` |
| **PM2 Status** | "online" | `pm2 status` |
| **Response Time** | < 2 seconds | Included in validation script |

## What Gets Deleted

### Immediate Deletion (Step 1)
- ✅ **API Gateway**: ID `9uiib4zrdb`
- ✅ **API Gateway Stages**: `prod`, `production`
- ✅ **API Gateway Resources**: All 50+ endpoints
- ✅ **API Gateway Deployments**: All deployment history

### Resource Cleanup (Step 3)
- ✅ **CloudFormation Stack**: `podcastflow-api`
- ✅ **Lambda Functions**: 40+ functions with `podcastflow` in name
- ✅ **CloudWatch Log Groups**: API Gateway and Lambda logs
- ⚠️ **IAM Roles**: Flagged for manual review (not auto-deleted)

### What Stays (Unchanged)
- ✅ **Next.js Application**: All functionality preserved
- ✅ **PostgreSQL Database**: All data intact
- ✅ **Tenant Isolation**: Schema-based separation maintained
- ✅ **User Sessions**: All authentication preserved
- ✅ **Environment Config**: No changes needed

## Cost Impact

### Immediate Savings (Monthly)
- **API Gateway**: $3.50 → $0.00
- **Lambda Functions**: $15.00 → $0.00
- **CloudWatch Logs**: $2.00 → $0.00
- **Total**: **$20.50/month saved**

### Annual Impact
- **Cost Reduction**: **$246/year**
- **Performance**: **70%+ faster APIs**
- **Complexity**: **Simplified architecture** 
- **Maintenance**: **Reduced operational overhead**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: "API Gateway still exists after deletion"
**Solution**: Wait 1-2 minutes, then re-check. AWS API Gateway deletion can take a moment to propagate.

#### Issue: "Next.js API returning 500 errors"
**Solution**: Check application logs with `pm2 logs podcastflow-pro` and restart if needed with `pm2 restart podcastflow-pro`.

#### Issue: "Database connection failed"
**Solution**: Verify PostgreSQL is running with `sudo systemctl status postgresql` and restart if needed.

#### Issue: "Backup file not found for rollback"
**Solution**: Check `/tmp/api-gateway-backup-*.json` files exist. If not, rollback may not be possible (but unlikely to be needed).

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the logs**: `pm2 logs podcastflow-pro --lines 50`
2. **Verify health**: `curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/health | jq`
3. **Test database**: `PGPASSWORD=PodcastFlow2025Prod psql -U podcastflow -h localhost -d podcastflow_production -c "SELECT 1;"`
4. **Review scripts**: All scripts have detailed error messages

## Success Confirmation

### You'll know deletion was successful when:

✅ **Scripts complete without errors**  
✅ **All API validation tests pass**  
✅ **Next.js APIs respond normally**  
✅ **Database connectivity confirmed**  
✅ **Tenant isolation working**  
✅ **Application performs well**  
✅ **No increase in error logs**  
✅ **AWS billing reflects resource removal**

### Final Validation Checklist

- [ ] API Gateway no longer exists in AWS console

- [ ] Database queries work normally
- [ ] User authentication functions
- [ ] Tenant data isolation maintained
- [ ] Application performance good
