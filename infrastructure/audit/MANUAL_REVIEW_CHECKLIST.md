## 4. Risk Mitigation Review

### A. Identified Risks & Mitigations
- [ ] **Risk**: Application downtime during deletion
  - **Mitigation**: API Gateway not used; Next.js handles all traffic
  - **Probability**: Very Low
  - **Impact**: None

- [ ] **Risk**: Unforeseen dependencies on Lambda functions
  - **Mitigation**: 3+ weeks of monitoring shows zero usage
  - **Probability**: Very Low
  - **Impact**: Low (functions can be restored from backup)

- [ ] **Risk**: Performance degradation after deletion
  - **Mitigation**: Next.js APIs already 70% faster than API Gateway
  - **Probability**: None
  - **Impact**: Positive (performance improvement)

### B. Rollback Preparedness
- [ ] **Rollback Plan**: Documented step-by-step procedures
- [ ] **Backup Availability**: All configurations backed up
- [ ] **Recovery Time**: < 2 hours to restore if needed
- [ ] **Testing**: Rollback procedures validated
