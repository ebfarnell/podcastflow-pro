# Commercial Readiness Checklist for PodcastFlow Pro

## üö® CRITICAL - Must Complete Before Launch

### 1. Security & Compliance
- [ ] **SSL/TLS Certificate** - HTTPS is mandatory for production
  ```bash
  # Option 1: Use AWS Certificate Manager with CloudFront
  # Option 2: Let's Encrypt with custom domain
  ```
- [ ] **Remove Development Credentials** - Current master password is exposed
- [ ] **API Keys Rotation** - Generate new AWS access keys for production
- [ ] **Enable MFA** - Multi-factor authentication for admin accounts
- [ ] **Security Headers** - Add CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options
- [ ] **GDPR/CCPA Compliance** - Privacy policy, data handling, user consent

### 2. Infrastructure Hardening
- [ ] **Custom Domain** - Register and configure production domain
- [ ] **CloudFront CDN** - Global content delivery and DDoS protection
- [ ] **WAF Rules** - Web Application Firewall for API protection
- [ ] **VPC Configuration** - Isolate Lambda functions in private subnets
- [ ] **Secrets Manager** - Move all API keys and secrets to AWS Secrets Manager

### 3. Legal Requirements
- [ ] **Terms of Service** - Required for commercial operation
- [ ] **Privacy Policy** - Data collection and usage policies
- [ ] **Cookie Policy** - EU cookie law compliance
- [ ] **Business License** - Ensure proper business registration
- [ ] **Payment Processing Agreement** - Stripe/PayPal merchant account

### 4. Production Configuration
- [ ] **Environment Variables** - Separate dev/staging/prod environments
- [ ] **Error Tracking** - Sentry or similar error monitoring
- [ ] **Analytics** - Google Analytics or Mixpanel for usage tracking
- [ ] **Backup Strategy** - Automated daily backups with retention policy
- [ ] **Disaster Recovery** - Document recovery procedures

### 5. Performance & Monitoring
- [ ] **CloudWatch Alarms** - CPU, memory, error rate alerts
- [ ] **API Rate Limiting** - Prevent abuse and control costs
- [ ] **Database Indexes** - Optimize for production query patterns
- [ ] **Lambda Cold Start** - Implement warming strategy
- [ ] **Load Testing** - Verify system can handle expected traffic

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT - Highly Recommended

### 6. Payment Integration
- [ ] **Stripe Production Keys** - Switch from test to live keys
- [ ] **PCI Compliance** - If handling card data directly
- [ ] **Invoice Templates** - Professional invoice generation
- [ ] **Tax Calculation** - Automated tax handling
- [ ] **Refund Policy** - Clear refund procedures

### 7. User Management
- [ ] **Email Verification** - Verify user email addresses
- [ ] **Password Policy** - Enforce strong passwords
- [ ] **Session Management** - Secure session handling
- [ ] **Role-Based Access** - Implement proper permissions
- [ ] **Audit Logging** - Track all user actions

### 8. Data Protection
- [ ] **Encryption at Rest** - Already enabled for DynamoDB
- [ ] **Encryption in Transit** - Requires HTTPS setup
- [ ] **Data Retention Policy** - Define how long to keep data
- [ ] **Right to Deletion** - GDPR requirement
- [ ] **Data Export** - Allow users to export their data

### 9. Business Continuity
- [ ] **SLA Definition** - Service level agreements
- [ ] **Support System** - Help desk or ticketing system
- [ ] **Documentation** - User guides and API docs
- [ ] **Status Page** - Public system status monitoring
- [ ] **Incident Response Plan** - How to handle outages

### 10. Cost Management
- [ ] **AWS Budgets** - Set up cost alerts
- [ ] **Reserved Instances** - For predictable workloads
- [ ] **Auto-scaling Policies** - Scale based on demand
- [ ] **Cost Allocation Tags** - Track costs by feature
- [ ] **Usage Quotas** - Prevent runaway costs

## üìã Quick Start Commands

### Enable HTTPS with CloudFront
```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name podcastflow-cloudfront \
  --template-body file://cloudfront-template.yaml
```

### Set Up Production Secrets
```bash
# Store secrets in AWS Secrets Manager
aws secretsmanager create-secret \
  --name podcastflow/prod/stripe \
  --secret-string '{"publishableKey":"pk_live_xxx","secretKey":"sk_live_xxx"}'
```

### Enable Monitoring
```bash
# Create CloudWatch dashboard
aws cloudwatch put-dashboard \
  --dashboard-name PodcastFlowPro \
  --dashboard-body file://monitoring-dashboard.json
```

## üî¥ Current Security Issues to Fix

1. **Exposed Credentials**: The master password "EMunfy2025" is in plain text
2. **HTTP Only**: Currently running on HTTP, not HTTPS
3. **Open CORS**: API allows requests from any origin
4. **No Rate Limiting**: API can be abused without limits
5. **Development Mode**: Next.js is running in development mode

## üí∞ Estimated Monthly Costs (AWS)

- **Light Usage** (< 1000 users): ~$50-100/month
- **Medium Usage** (< 10,000 users): ~$200-500/month
- **Heavy Usage** (< 100,000 users): ~$1000-3000/month

Main cost drivers:
- Lambda invocations
- DynamoDB read/write capacity
- Data transfer
- CloudFront CDN usage

## ‚úÖ Ready for MVP/Beta Testing
The current setup is suitable for:
- Internal testing
- Beta users with disclaimer
- Proof of concept demonstrations

## ‚ùå NOT Ready for Full Commercial Launch
Still needs:
- Security hardening
- Legal compliance
- Payment processing
- Production monitoring
- Customer support system

**Recommendation**: Complete at least the CRITICAL section before accepting paying customers. The current setup is excellent for beta testing with trusted users while you complete the remaining items.
