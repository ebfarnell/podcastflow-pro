## 2. Technical Architecture

### Database Schema (DynamoDB)

```
Users Table:
PK: USER#<userId>
SK: PROFILE
Attributes:
- email
- name
- role (Admin|Seller|Producer|Talent|Client)
- organizationId
- createdAt
- updatedAt
- status (active|inactive|suspended)

Permissions Table:
PK: ROLE#<roleName>
SK: PERMISSION#<permissionName>
Attributes:
- resource
- actions[]
- conditions

User-Show Assignments:
PK: USER#<userId>
SK: SHOW#<showId>
Attributes:
- assignedAt
- assignedBy
- role (producer|talent)

Feature Flags:
PK: FEATURE#<featureName>
SK: ROLE#<roleName>
Attributes:
- enabled
- configuration
```

### API Structure

#### User Management APIs
- `POST /users` - Create new user (Admin only)
- `GET /users` - List users (Admin only)
- `GET /users/{id}` - Get user details
- `PUT /users/{id}` - Update user
- `DELETE /users/{id}` - Delete user (Admin only)
- `PUT /users/{id}/role` - Assign role (Admin only)
- `GET /users/{id}/permissions` - Get user permissions

#### Role-Specific APIs
- `GET /dashboard/{role}` - Get role-specific dashboard data
- `GET /features/{role}` - Get enabled features for role
- `POST /permissions/check` - Check if user has permission

#### Assignment APIs
- `POST /shows/{id}/assign` - Assign producer/talent to show
- `DELETE /shows/{id}/assign/{userId}` - Remove assignment
- `GET /users/{id}/shows` - Get user's assigned shows

## 3. Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Core Role System (Week 1)

3. **Testing**
   - Create test accounts
   - End-to-end testing
   - Security testing

## 4. Frontend Components

### New Components to Create
```typescript
// Role Guard Component
<RoleGuard roles={['admin', 'seller']}>
  <ProtectedComponent />
</RoleGuard>

// Feature Flag Component
<FeatureFlag feature="billing">
  <BillingDashboard />
</FeatureFlag>

// Role-Based Navigation
<Navigation role={currentUser.role} />
```

### Context Providers
```typescript
// Role Context
const RoleContext = React.createContext({
  role: null,
  permissions: [],
  checkPermission: (resource, action) => boolean
});

// Feature Context  
const FeatureContext = React.createContext({
  features: {},
  isEnabled: (feature) => boolean
});
```

## 5. Security Considerations

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Add role claim to JWT tokens
   - Validate role on each request
   - Implement refresh token rotation

2. **Authorization**
   - Resource-based permissions
   - Row-level security in DynamoDB
   - API Gateway policies

3. **Audit Trail**
   - Log all role changes
   - Track permission usage
   - Monitor failed access attempts

## 6. Migration Strategy

1. **Existing Users**
   - Default all current users to Admin role
   - Create migration script
   - Notify users of changes

2. **Gradual Rollout**
   - Enable features incrementally
   - Test with small user group
   - Monitor for issues

## 7. Success Metrics

- User adoption rate by role
- Time to complete common tasks
- Security incident reduction
- Feature usage analytics
- User satisfaction scores

## 8. Timeline Summary

- **Week 1**: Core role system and infrastructure
- **Week 2**: Admin features and ad approval workflow
- **Week 3-4**: Seller features and CRM
- **Week 4-5**: Producer features and analytics
- **Week 5-6**: Integration, testing, and deployment

Total estimated time: 6 weeks for full implementation
