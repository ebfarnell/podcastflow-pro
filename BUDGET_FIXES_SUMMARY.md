# Budget System Fixes Summary - July 31, 2025

## Issues Resolved

### 1. API Errors - BudgetRollupCache References Removed
- **Issue**: API was failing with "column BudgetRollupCache does not exist" errors
- **Root Cause**: Code was still referencing the deprecated BudgetRollupCache table
- **Fix**: Completely removed all BudgetRollupCache references from:
  - `/src/app/api/budget/comparison/route.ts` - Updated to use HierarchicalBudget table with dynamic calculations
  - `/src/lib/db/schema-db.ts` - Removed getBudgetRollups and refreshBudgetRollupCache methods, replaced with calculateBudgetRollups
  - Database schemas - Dropped BudgetRollupCache table and related functions from all org schemas

### 2. Show Table Missing Columns
- **Issue**: API was failing with "column selloutProjection does not exist" errors
- **Root Cause**: Show table was missing selloutProjection and estimatedEpisodeValue columns
- **Fix**: Added missing columns to Show table in all org schemas:
  - `selloutProjection` - DOUBLE PRECISION DEFAULT 0
  - `estimatedEpisodeValue` - DOUBLE PRECISION DEFAULT 0
  - Verified columns exist and are accessible via API

## Code Changes

### Modified Files

1. **`/src/app/api/budget/comparison/route.ts`**
   - Replaced all BudgetRollupCache queries with HierarchicalBudget queries
   - Updated query logic to calculate rollups dynamically
   - Fixed parameter indexing for prepared statements

2. **`/src/lib/db/schema-db.ts`**
   - Removed `getBudgetRollups()` method
   - Removed `refreshBudgetRollupCache()` method  
   - Added `calculateBudgetRollups()` method for dynamic calculations

3. **`/src/components/budget/UnifiedBudgetPlanning.tsx`**
   - Added `useAuth()` hook to check user role
   - Added `canEdit` permission check (only admin/master can edit)
   - Edit button now only shows for authorized users

### Database Changes

1. **Removed BudgetRollupCache**
   - Dropped table from all org schemas
   - Dropped related functions: `update_budget_rollup_cache`, `trigger_update_budget_rollup_cache`
   - Removed triggers on HierarchicalBudget table

2. **Added Show Columns**
   - Added `selloutProjection` column to Show table in all org schemas
   - Added `estimatedEpisodeValue` column to Show table in all org schemas
   - Both columns default to 0 and are of type DOUBLE PRECISION

## Verification Results

### âœ… All Tests Passed

1. **Budget Endpoints**
   - Admin user can access all budget endpoints successfully
   - Sales user has restricted access (only sees their own data)
   - Dynamic rollups calculate correctly without BudgetRollupCache

2. **Show Endpoints**  
   - Shows API returns all fields including selloutProjection and estimatedEpisodeValue
   - Individual show endpoint returns the fields with proper values

3. **UI Components**
   - Rollup rows (Seller/Agency totals) are read-only with explanatory tooltips
   - Edit button only appears for admin/master roles
   - Dynamic calculations work correctly in the UI

4. **Database Integrity**
   - No BudgetRollupCache references remain in any schema
   - Show tables have required columns in all org schemas
   - All migrations completed successfully

## Business Rules Maintained

1. **Budget Hierarchy**
   - Advertiser budgets roll up to Agency level
   - Agency budgets roll up to Seller level  
   - All rollups are calculated dynamically (no cache)

2. **Access Control**
   - Only admin and master roles can edit budgets
   - Sales users can only view their assigned entities
   - Rollup rows remain read-only for all users

3. **Data Integrity**
   - selloutProjection and estimatedEpisodeValue retained for business logic
   - Optimistic locking still in place via updatedAt column
   - No double-counting in rollup calculations

## Deployment Notes

1. Application has been restarted via PM2
2. All database migrations have been applied
3. No data loss occurred during the fixes
4. System is functioning normally with all recent features intact
