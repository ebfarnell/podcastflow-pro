# Troubleshooting Site Access

## Your Site IS Working! ðŸŸ¢

The infrastructure is fully operational:
- âœ… DNS is resolving correctly
- âœ… SSL certificate is active
- âœ… Application is running
- âœ… Load balancer is healthy

## Why You Can't Access It

Most likely causes:

### 1. **Browser DNS Cache**
Your browser may be caching old DNS records.

**Fix:**
- Clear browser cache: `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (Mac)
- Clear DNS cache:
  - Windows: `ipconfig /flushdns`
  - Mac: `sudo dscacheutil -flushcache`
  - Linux: `sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches`

### 2. **Try Different Methods**
- **Incognito/Private Mode**: Opens fresh without cache
- **Different Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Mobile Phone**: Use cellular data (not WiFi)
- **Different Device**: Another computer

### 3. **Local Network Issues**
Some corporate networks or ISPs cache DNS aggressively.

**Test from phone on cellular:**
1. Turn off WiFi
2. Open https://app.podcastflow.pro
3. Should load immediately

### 4. **Direct Test Links**
Try these to diagnose:

1. **Test DNS Resolution**:
   Open command prompt/terminal:
   ```
   nslookup app.podcastflow.pro
   ```
   Should return IP addresses

2. **Test with IP**:
   Try: http://34.230.224.46
   (This should redirect to HTTPS)

3. **Check SSL Certificate**:
   https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=app.podcastflow.pro

## Quick Fixes to Try

### On Windows:
```cmd
# Run as Administrator
ipconfig /flushdns
ipconfig /registerdns
ipconfig /release
ipconfig /renew
```

### On Mac:
```bash
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache
sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
```

### Router Reset:
1. Unplug router for 30 seconds
2. Plug back in
3. Wait 2 minutes
4. Try again

## Test Right Now

The fastest test:
1. **Get your phone**
2. **Turn OFF WiFi** (use cellular)
3. **Open browser**
4. **Go to**: https://app.podcastflow.pro

This bypasses all local caching issues.

## Still Not Working?

If mobile on cellular doesn't work:

1. **Check Nameserver Update**:
   - Log into Namecheap
   - Verify nameservers are set to AWS ones
   - Should show: ns-1821.awsdns-35.co.uk, etc.

2. **Wait a bit more**:
   - Although DNS has propagated globally
   - Some ISPs can take up to 48 hours
   - But 99% work within 1 hour

3. **Verification Command**:
   ```bash
   curl -I https://app.podcastflow.pro
   ```
   
   If this works from the EC2 instance but not your computer, it's definitely a local DNS issue.
