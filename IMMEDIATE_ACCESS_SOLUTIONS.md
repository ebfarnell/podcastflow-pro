## Why This Is Happening

Your ISP (Internet Service Provider) caches DNS records aggressively. Even though the domain is working worldwide, your local ISP hasn't updated yet. This can take:
- Usually: 15-30 minutes
- Sometimes: 2-4 hours  
- Rarely: Up to 24 hours

## Quick Test

Open your phone browser (on cellular, not WiFi) and go to:
https://app.podcastflow.pro

It should load immediately, proving the site is working!
