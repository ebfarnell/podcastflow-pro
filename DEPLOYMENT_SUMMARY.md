- Optimized Lambda functions
- React Query for efficient data fetching

## Next Steps for Full Production

### 1. Domain & SSL
```bash
# Add custom domain to API Gateway
# Configure Route 53 for DNS
# Enable SSL certificates
```

### 2. Enhanced Security
- Enable AWS WAF for API protection
- Configure VPC for Lambda functions
- Implement API rate limiting
- Add multi-factor authentication

### 3. Monitoring & Logging
- Set up CloudWatch dashboards
- Configure alerts for errors
- Enable X-Ray for distributed tracing
- Implement application monitoring

### 4. Additional Features (Pending)
- Real-time updates with WebSockets
- Stripe payment processing integration
- Advanced reporting with data exports
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Comprehensive error handling

## Maintenance Commands

### Start Development Server
```bash
cd /home/ec2-user/podcastflow-pro
npm run dev
```

### View Logs
```bash
# API Gateway logs
aws logs tail /aws/api-gateway/podcastflow-pro --follow

# Lambda logs
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/podcastflow-api-campaigns --follow
```

### Database Operations
```bash
# Query campaigns
aws dynamodb query \
  --table-name podcastflow-pro \
  --index-name GSI1 \
  --key-condition-expression "GSI1PK = :pk" \
  --expression-attribute-values '{":pk":{"S":"CAMPAIGNS"}}'
```

### Deployment Scripts
All infrastructure scripts are located in:
```
/home/ec2-user/podcastflow-pro/infrastructure/scripts/
```

## Support & Documentation

### API Documentation
The API follows RESTful conventions:
- GET /campaigns - List all campaigns
- GET /campaigns/{id} - Get specific campaign
- POST /campaigns - Create new campaign
- PUT /campaigns/{id} - Update campaign
- DELETE /campaigns/{id} - Delete campaign

### Troubleshooting
1. If frontend won't load: Check security group ports (3000, 3001)
2. If API returns errors: Check Lambda logs in CloudWatch
3. If login fails: Verify Cognito user pool configuration

## Cost Optimization

Current setup uses:
- DynamoDB: Provisioned capacity (5 RCU/5 WCU)
- Lambda: 128MB memory, 30s timeout
- API Gateway: Standard pricing

For production, consider:
- DynamoDB On-Demand for variable workloads
- Lambda memory optimization based on usage
- API Gateway caching for frequently accessed data
