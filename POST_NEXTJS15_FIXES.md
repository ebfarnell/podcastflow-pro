# Post Next.js 15 Migration Fixes

## Summary

After successfully upgrading to Next.js 15.4.3, we identified and fixed three issues that were causing errors in the logs.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. SystemMetric Database Schema Mismatch ✅

**Problem**: The monitoring service was trying to write to `cpuUsage` field but the database column was named `cpu`.

**Solution**: Updated the monitoring service to map field names correctly:
- Modified `recordMetrics()` in `/src/lib/monitoring/monitoring-service.ts` to transform field names
- Modified `getMetrics()` to transform database fields back to expected interface
- Maps: `cpuUsage` → `cpu`, `memoryUsage` → `memory`, `diskUsage` → `disk`

**Result**: System metrics are now being recorded without errors.

### 2. Campaign Table Multi-Tenant Access Error ✅

**Problem**: The campaign analytics service was trying to access `public.Campaign` table, but campaigns are stored in organization-specific schemas (e.g., `org_podcastflow_pro.Campaign`).

**Solution**: Updated `getCampaignMetrics()` in `/src/lib/analytics/campaign-analytics.ts`:
- Added optional `orgSlug` parameter
- Uses schema-aware `querySchema()` when org slug is provided
- Falls back to public schema for backward compatibility
- Handles errors gracefully when campaign not found

**Result**: Campaign queries no longer throw "table does not exist" errors.

### 3. Location Not Defined Build Warning ⚠️

**Problem**: During build, there's a warning about `location is not defined` in the campaigns/new page.

**Analysis**: This appears to be a build-time warning when Next.js tries to pre-render the page. Since the page has `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`, it shouldn't affect runtime behavior.

**Status**: Non-critical warning that doesn't affect functionality. The application runs correctly despite this warning.

## Verification

All fixes have been applied and the application is running successfully:
- ✅ Next.js 15.4.3 running in production
- ✅ Authentication working correctly
- ✅ APIs responding without errors
- ✅ System monitoring recording metrics
- ✅ Campaign APIs functioning (with appropriate schema access)

## Additional Notes

1. The multi-tenant architecture requires all business data queries to use organization-specific schemas
2. Some older code may still reference public schema directly and will need gradual migration
3. The monitoring system now correctly maps between interface field names and database column names
4. Build warnings about `location` don't affect runtime and can be investigated later if needed

## Files Modified

1. `/src/lib/monitoring/monitoring-service.ts` - Fixed metric field mapping
2. `/src/lib/analytics/campaign-analytics.ts` - Added schema-aware campaign access
3. `/next.config.js` - Moved `serverComponentsExternalPackages` to `serverExternalPackages`
4. `/src/app/signup/page.tsx` - Changed `<a>` tags to `<Link>` components
