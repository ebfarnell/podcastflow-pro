# Next.js 15.4.3 Migration Complete

## Migration Summary

PodcastFlow Pro has been successfully upgraded from Next.js 14.1.0 to Next.js 15.4.3 on July 24, 2025.

## Changes Made

### 1. Pre-Migration Fixes
- Fixed standalone `<a>` tags in signup page to use Next.js `<Link>` components
- Removed deprecated `swcMinify: true` from next.config.js (now default)

### 2. Package Updates
- Updated Next.js from 14.1.0 to 15.4.3
- Updated eslint-config-next to 15.4.3
- Kept React at 18.3.1 (backward compatibility maintained)
- Kept TypeScript at 5.8.3

### 3. Configuration Updates
- Moved `serverComponentsExternalPackages` to `serverExternalPackages` (top level)
- Removed experimental config options that are no longer valid

### 4. Codemod Applied
The Next.js 15 codemod was run but minimal changes were needed since:
- App already uses App Router (no Pages Router migration needed)
- All components are client-side (no async API changes needed)
- No usage of deprecated features

## Test Results

- Static pages generated correctly
- Build time: ~4.3 minutes
