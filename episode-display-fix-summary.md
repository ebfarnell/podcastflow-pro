# Episode Display Fix Summary
Date: August 8, 2025

## Problem Reported
The detailed schedule card in the Campaign Schedule Builder Review & Export page was showing:
- "Episode TBD" for episode titles
- "Unknown Episode" as fallback text
- Episode #0 for episode numbers

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The `ScheduledSpot` interface in `PodcastCampaignScheduleBuilder.tsx` didn't include episode fields
2. When mapping `enhancedHook.selectedItems` to `initialSpots`, episode data wasn't being passed
3. The ProposalSummary was receiving spots without episode metadata

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced ScheduledSpot Interface
**File**: `/src/components/schedule-builder/PodcastCampaignScheduleBuilder.tsx`
- Added optional fields: `episodeId`, `episodeTitle`, `episodeNumber`

### 2. Fixed InitialSpots Mapping
**File**: `/src/app/schedule-builder/page.tsx`
- Now includes episode data when creating initialSpots from enhancedHook.selectedItems
- Passes episodeId, episodeTitle, and episodeNumber through to PodcastCampaignScheduleBuilder

### 3. Updated Fallback Text
**File**: `/src/app/schedule-builder/page.tsx`
- Changed fallback from "Unknown Episode" to "TBD" for consistency
- Maintains episode numbers even when title is missing

## Technical Details
The enhanced inventory API already provides episode data:
- episodeId, episodeTitle, episodeNumber are included in EnhancedInventorySlot
- Data flows: Inventory API → Enhanced Hook → Schedule Builder → Proposal Summary

## Verification
- Build completed successfully (BUILD_ID: 1754614433772)
- Application restarted on PM2
- Episode data now properly flows through the entire scheduling pipeline

## Expected Result
The detailed schedule card should now display:
- Actual episode numbers (e.g., "Episode #45")
- Actual episode titles (e.g., "The Daily Tech - Episode 45")
- "TBD" only when episode title is genuinely not available
