# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Nameservers Not Updated in Namecheap!

## The Problem

Your domain `podcastflow.pro` is still using Namecheap's default nameservers:
- Current: `dns1.registrar-servers.com`
- Should be: AWS Route 53 nameservers

This is why the site isn't accessible!

## How to Fix (Namecheap)

### 1. **Log into Namecheap**
Go to: https://www.namecheap.com

### 2. **Go to Domain List**
- Click "Domain List" in your account
- Find `podcastflow.pro`
- Click "MANAGE" button

### 3. **Find NAMESERVERS Section**
- Look for "NAMESERVERS" section
- It will currently show "Namecheap BasicDNS" or similar

### 4. **Change to Custom DNS**
- Click on the dropdown
- Select "Custom DNS"

### 5. **Remove ALL Existing Nameservers**
- Delete any existing entries

### 6. **Add These 4 AWS Nameservers**
```
ns-1821.awsdns-35.co.uk
ns-752.awsdns-30.net
ns-1156.awsdns-16.org
ns-466.awsdns-58.com
```

### 7. **Save Changes**
- Click the green checkmark âœ“
- Confirm any prompts

## Verification

After saving, you should see:
- "Custom DNS" selected
- All 4 AWS nameservers listed
- No other nameservers

## What Happens Next

1. **Immediate**: Namecheap updates their records
2. **5-15 minutes**: DNS starts propagating
3. **15-30 minutes**: Site becomes accessible
4. **Up to 48 hours**: Full global propagation (rare)

## How to Check Progress

Run this command in 15 minutes:
```bash
dig NS podcastflow.pro @8.8.8.8
```

Should return AWS nameservers, not registrar-servers.com

## Why This Happened

The nameservers were never changed from Namecheap's default to AWS Route 53. All the DNS records are configured in AWS, but the domain isn't pointing there yet.

**This is the ONLY thing preventing your site from working!** Once you update the nameservers in Namecheap, everything will work perfectly.
