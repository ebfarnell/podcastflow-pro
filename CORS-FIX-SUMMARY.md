# CORS Configuration Fix Summary

**Date**: 2025-07-05
**Issue**: API blocking requests from https://app.podcastflow.pro due to missing CORS headers

## Changes Made

### 1. Lambda Environment Variables Updated
All Lambda functions now have the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable set to:
```
https://app.podcastflow.pro,https://podcastflow.pro
```

Updated functions:
- podcastflow-api-user
- podcastflow-api-campaigns
- podcastflow-api-analytics
- podcastflow-api-organization
- podcastflow-websocket-handler

### 2. Lambda Function Code Updated
Deployed new Lambda code that:
- Reads the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable
- Dynamically sets CORS headers based on the request origin
- Properly handles OPTIONS preflight requests
- Returns appropriate CORS headers for all responses

### 3. CORS Headers Configuration
The following headers are now returned:
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: [matching origin from allowed list]
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type,X-Amz-Date,Authorization,X-Api-Key,X-Amz-Security-Token
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

## Scripts Created

1. **`/infrastructure/scripts/fix-cors-immediate.sh`**
   - Updates Lambda environment variables with allowed origins

2. **`/infrastructure/scripts/fix-marketing-api-cors.sh`**
   - Deploys updated Lambda code with proper CORS handling
   - Main script used to fix the issue

3. **`/infrastructure/lambdas/shared/cors.js`**
   - Shared CORS module for future Lambda development

## Testing the Fix

To verify CORS is working:

1. Open your browser's developer console
2. Navigate to https://app.podcastflow.pro
3. Make an API request to https://6a2opgfepf.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/
4. You should no longer see CORS errors

## Important Notes

1. **Browser Cache**: Clear your browser cache if you still see CORS errors
2. **Authorization**: Ensure the Authorization header is properly set for authenticated requests
3. **API Gateway**: The API uses proxy integration, so CORS must be handled at the Lambda level

## Future Maintenance

When creating new Lambda functions:
1. Include the shared CORS module: `require('../shared/cors')`
2. Use `getCORSHeaders(event)` to get proper headers
3. Always handle OPTIONS requests
4. Set the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable during deployment

## Rollback Instructions

If needed, to rollback:
1. Redeploy the original Lambda function code
2. Remove the ALLOWED_ORIGINS environment variable
3. The functions will revert to allowing all origins (`*`)

## Additional Allowed Origins

To add more allowed origins in the future:
1. Update the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable
2. Add domains separated by commas
3. No code changes needed - the Lambda functions will automatically use the new list
