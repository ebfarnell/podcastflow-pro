# Tenant Isolation Audit Report
Generated: 2025-08-04

## Executive Summary

Critical tenant isolation issues were found in the PodcastFlow Pro application:

1. **Row Level Security (RLS) is NOT enabled** on any tables in the database
2. **Tenant isolation functions exist but are NOT being used** by the application
3. **Several API endpoints have incomplete isolation** with potential security vulnerabilities
4. **No RLS policies are active** despite having a comprehensive RLS script available

## Critical Findings

### 1. Database Level Issues

#### RLS Not Enabled
- **ALL tables in both public and organization schemas have RLS disabled**
- The RLS enablement script exists at `/infrastructure/security/enable-row-level-security.sql` but has NOT been applied
- No policies are protecting data at the database level

#### Tenant Functions Not Used
The following tenant isolation functions exist but are NOT called from application code:
- `set_tenant_context(user_id, org_id)` - Should be called at session start
- `ensure_tenant_isolation(query, model, operation)` - Should wrap all queries
- `current_user_id()`, `current_org_id()`, `current_org_schema()` - Context functions unused

### 2. Application Level Issues

#### Mixed Isolation Patterns
- **Good**: Most business data APIs use `withTenantIsolation` wrapper and `getTenantClient`
- **Bad**: These rely on application-level checks only, no database enforcement
- **Critical**: Some APIs have partial isolation with security holes

#### Specific Vulnerabilities Found

1. **File Upload API** (`/api/files/[id]/route.ts`):
   - Lines 183-192: DELETE operation doesn't check organizationId in WHERE clause
   - Could allow deletion of files from other organizations
   
2. **User API** (`/api/users/route.ts`):
   - Properly filters by organization at application level
   - But no RLS backup if application logic fails

3. **Public Schema Tables** - No isolation at all:
   - SystemMetric
   - MonitoringAlert
   - SystemLog
   - ServiceHealth
   - EmailSuppressionList
   - SystemEmailTemplate

### 3. Missing Tenant Isolation

#### Tables Without Any Isolation:
1. **In Public Schema** (should have RLS):
   - User - Can see users from other organizations
   - Session - Can potentially hijack sessions
   - Organization - Can see all organizations
   - UploadedFile - Partial isolation, DELETE vulnerability
   - DeletionRequest - Can see deletion requests from other orgs
   - UsageRecord - Can see usage from other orgs
   - EmailLog, EmailQueue - Can see emails from other orgs
   - Notification - Can see notifications from other orgs

2. **In Organization Schemas** (protected by schema isolation but no RLS):
   - All 59 tables have no RLS policies
   - Relying only on schema isolation
   - If schema context is compromised, no secondary protection

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Apply RLS to Database

```bash
# Apply the existing RLS script
PGPASSWORD=PodcastFlow2025Prod psql -U podcastflow -h localhost -d podcastflow_production -f /home/ec2-user/podcastflow-pro/infrastructure/security/enable-row-level-security.sql
```

### 2. Fix Critical Vulnerabilities

#### File API Fix Required:
```typescript
// Line 183 needs organizationId check
await prisma.uploadedFile.update({
  where: {
    id,
    organizationId: session.organizationId // ADD THIS
  },
  data: {
    status: 'deleted',
    updatedAt: new Date()
  }
})
```

### 3. Implement Database Context Setting

Every API request should set the database context:
```typescript
// Add to session validation
await prisma.$executeRaw`SELECT set_tenant_context(${userId}, ${organizationId})`
```

### 4. Add RLS to Organization Schema Tables

While schema isolation provides primary protection, RLS should be added as defense-in-depth.

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas:
1. **File Management** - Direct vulnerability allowing cross-org file deletion
2. **User/Session Data** - No RLS means potential session hijacking
3. **Email System** - All email data visible across organizations
4. **Monitoring Data** - System logs may contain sensitive cross-org data

### Medium Risk Areas:
1. **Business Data** - Protected by schema isolation but no RLS backup
2. **Analytics Data** - Could expose business metrics if schema context fails

### Low Risk Areas:
1. **BillingPlan** - Shared data, intentionally public
2. **SystemMetric** - Platform-wide metrics, low sensitivity

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Within 24 hours):
1. Apply the RLS enablement script
2. Fix the file deletion vulnerability
3. Add tenant context setting to all API routes
4. Enable RLS on critical public tables (User, Session, Organization)

### Short-term (Within 1 week):
1. Add RLS policies to all public schema tables
2. Implement database-level audit logging
3. Add integration tests for cross-tenant access attempts
4. Review and fix any other partial isolation issues

### Long-term (Within 1 month):
1. Add RLS to organization schema tables as defense-in-depth
2. Implement automated tenant isolation testing
3. Add monitoring for cross-tenant access attempts
4. Regular security audits of tenant isolation

## Testing Checklist

After implementing fixes, test:
- [ ] Cannot see users from other organizations
- [ ] Cannot delete files from other organizations  
- [ ] Cannot access sessions from other organizations
- [ ] Cannot see emails from other organizations
- [ ] Cannot see deletion requests from other organizations
- [ ] Master account can still access all data (with audit logging)
- [ ] Regular users confined to their organization
- [ ] API errors don't expose data from other tenants

## Conclusion

The tenant isolation system has good architectural design but critical implementation gaps. The application relies entirely on application-level checks with no database enforcement. This creates multiple vulnerabilities that could allow cross-tenant data access.

Immediate action is required to:
1. Enable RLS on all tables
2. Fix the file deletion vulnerability
3. Implement proper database context setting
4. Add comprehensive testing

The fixes are straightforward since the RLS policies and functions already exist - they just need to be applied and integrated into the application flow.
