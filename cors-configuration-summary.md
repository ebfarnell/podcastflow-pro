- **Region**: us-east-1

2. **Added CORS response headers to all HTTP methods:**
   - Added `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` header to all GET, POST, PUT, DELETE method responses
   - Configured OPTIONS methods with full CORS headers:
     - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
     - `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,OPTIONS`
     - `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type,X-Amz-Date,Authorization,X-Api-Key,X-Amz-Security-Token`

3. **Deployment:**
   - Successfully deployed all changes to the `prod` stage

   - Deployment completed at: 2025-07-04T01:52:33+00:00

### Verification
- Tested OPTIONS request to `/dashboard` endpoint
- Confirmed CORS headers are properly returned:
  ```
  access-control-allow-origin: *
  access-control-allow-headers: Content-Type,X-Amz-Date,Authorization,X-Api-Key,X-Amz-Security-Token
  access-control-allow-methods: GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,OPTIONS
  ```

### Script Location
- The configuration script is saved at: `/home/ec2-user/podcastflow-pro/add-cors-configuration.sh`
- This script can be reused if needed to reapply CORS configuration

### Important Notes
- All endpoints now support CORS with wildcard origin (`*`)
- For production use, consider restricting the allowed origins to specific domains
- Lambda proxy integrations will need to include CORS headers in their responses as well
