- ✅ Security Lambda has USER_POOL_ID and ENCRYPTION_KEY
- ✅ API Gateway ID provided to APIWebhooks Lambda

### 6. Frontend Components Updated
All settings components now use real API endpoints:
- ✅ TeamSettings.tsx - Uses teamApi
- ✅ SecuritySettings.tsx - Uses securityApi

## Remaining Configuration Tasks

### 1. Stripe Configuration (Manual)
The Billing Lambda needs real Stripe keys:
```bash
aws lambda update-function-configuration \
  --function-name PodcastFlowPro-Billing \
  --environment Variables="{TABLE_NAME=PodcastFlowPro,STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_YOUR_REAL_KEY}"
```

### 2. Complete API Gateway Sub-Resources
Some nested resources and methods may need to be added for full functionality.

### 3. CORS Configuration
Full CORS headers need to be configured for all endpoints to work properly with the frontend.

### 4. Testing
Run comprehensive tests to ensure all endpoints work correctly.

## CloudWatch Log Groups
Monitor these log groups for debugging:
- `/aws/lambda/PodcastFlowPro-Team`
- `/aws/lambda/PodcastFlowPro-Security`
- `/aws/lambda/PodcastFlowPro-Billing`
- `/aws/lambda/PodcastFlowPro-APIWebhooks`
- `/aws/lambda/PodcastFlowPro-Backup`

## Next Steps

1. **Test all endpoints** - Use the test script or manual testing
2. **Configure production secrets** - Add real Stripe keys
3. **Monitor CloudWatch** - Check for any errors
4. **Frontend deployment** - Ensure Amplify has deployed latest changes

## Important Notes

- All Lambda functions are using Node.js 18.x runtime
- DynamoDB single-table design is used (table: PodcastFlowPro)
- Authentication is handled via AWS Cognito
- API Gateway uses AWS_IAM authorization type
- Backup files are stored in S3 with encryption
